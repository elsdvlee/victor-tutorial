# Implementation process pipeline

This template repo helps with setting up a pipeline for an OSLO implementation process (implementatietraject).

- [Application profile]({{AP-URL}})
- [SHACL]({{SHACL-URL}})

## Usage

### Setting up this repository

You only have to do these steps once.

1. [Create a new repository based on this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Navigate to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions and
   make sure that "Read and write permissions" is checked.
3. [Set up GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
   and let it point to the `docs` directory on the `main` branch.
4. Set the link to the application profile at `env.ap_url` in the file `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`.
5. Set the link to the SHACL at `env.shacl_url` in the file `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`.
6. Read and, if necessary, update [the license](LICENSE).
7. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
   This will trigger the workflows, which will also add example data to the [example-data](./example-data) directory.
8. Navigate to Actions and make sure that there are no errors in the workflows.
9. Copy the Excel files in the `example-data` directory to the [data](./data) directory.
10. Once the workflows have finished, the dashboard is available via your GitHub pages.
11. If everything works, empty the [data](./data) directory.
    You can now start [adding data](#adding-data-via-an-excel-file).
12. [Configure the dashboard](#configure-the-dashboard).

### Configure the dashboard

You can configure the dashboard via the following steps:

1. Create a copy of [this directory](https://github.com/RMLio/ap-data-to-dashboard/blob/main/miravi-initial-config/)
   in the root of the repo and rename it to `dashboard-config`.
2. Update the content of `dashboard-config`.
   You find the options of the dasboard in `dashboard-config/config.json`.
   See [this section](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/miravi-a-linked-data-viewer?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-file)
   for more information about the different options.
   You don't need to add the option `comunicaContext`,
   because the pipeline sets this automatically.
   You store queries in `dashboard-config/public/queries`.

### Adding data via an Excel file
